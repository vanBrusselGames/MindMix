    m_Localized: 'The goal of the game is to move all of the cards to the ''foundations''
      these are four additional stacks of cards. At the start of the game these stacks
      are empty. Each stack represents a suit (hearts, clubs, etc). They must be
      stacked by suit and in order, starting with the Ace, then the 2, 3, 4, ...
      ending with the Queen and then King.


      Cards that are face up and showing
      may be moved from the stock pile or the columns to the foundation stacks or
      to other columns. To move a card to a column, it must be one less in rank and
      the opposite color. Stacks of cards may be moved from one column to another
      as long as they maintain the same order (highest to lowest, alternating colors).
      If you get an empty column, you can start a new column with a King.


      To
      get new cards from the stock pile, you turn one card at a time face up into
      the stack next to the stock pile called the waist stack. You can only play
      the top card off the waist stack. If you run out of stock cards, turn the waist
      stack over to make a new stock pile and start again.'

    m_Localized: 'In Minesweeper, mines are scattered throughout a board, which is
      divided into cells. Cells have three states: uncovered, covered and flagged.
      A covered cell is blank and clickable, while an uncovered cell is exposed.
      Flagged cells are those marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location.



      If
      a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per
      game. Otherwise, the uncovered cell displays either a number, indicating the
      number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (''-''),
      and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered. In flag-mode,
      clicking on a cell will flag it, causing a flag to appear on it. Flagged cells
      are still considered covered, and a player can click on them to uncover them,
      although  they must first be unflagged with an additional flag-mode click.
      You can switch between normal and flagmode by clicking the button with spade/flag
      icon.'
