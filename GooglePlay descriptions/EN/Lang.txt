MindMix is a collection of games that require you to use your mind!

The collection currently consists of 4 games:
- 2048;
- Minesweeper;
- Solitaire;
- Sudoku.
The explanation for each game can be found at the question mark in the top right corner.
The number of games will continue to increase with upcoming updates.

Coins can be earned by completing games. The more difficult level you have chosen or the more points you have collected, the more coins you will get for it!
These coins can be spent in the shop. Here you can buy wallpapers and later also special game modes.

MindMix can be played completely offline, but to save the progress there is the option to log in online with Google Play Games. So you can continue playing where you left off on other devices.

If you have any questions, comments, feedback or complaints, you can choose one of the support options in the app on the support page. You are also free to write a review.
All feedback is appreciated and used to give you and all other users the best experience!
